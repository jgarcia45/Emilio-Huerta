                    As a Civil Rights Attorney, Emilio Huerta has a thirty-year track record of fighting to improve the
                    lives of working families in Kern County and throughout the State of California.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Emilio has always believed that successful nonprofit organizations can positively impact the lives
                    of low-income families. Emilio has served as corporate counsel for Omni Family Health (a Kern County
                    based FQHC health-care organization), General Counsel for the Cesar Chavez Foundation, Board Chair
                    for Greater Bakersfield Legal Assistance (Kern County’s legal aid), and Board Chair of Self-Help
                    Federal Credit Union.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    As General Counsel for the Cesar Chavez Foundation, Emilio played an instrumental role in developing
                    more than $400 million in affordable housing in California, Arizona, Texas and New Mexico. His
                    knowledge of real estate, nonprofit law, and public financing has resulted in the development and
                    construction of primary health clinics in Kern, Fresno, Los Angeles, and San Diego County.

      <h6 class="font-weight-normal font-small grey-text mb-4">A message from Emilio himself</h6>


      <p>
        I’m running for the Board of Supervisors because it’s time to boldly address and implement real solutions to the
        problems facing Kern County’s families.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve been disappointed with the Board’s record in confronting and resolving our community’s most pressing
        issues. Our community simply can no longer tolerate ill-advised budgetary cuts in law enforcement, job creation,
        infrastructure repairs, the lack of delivery of mental health services, underfunded libraries and inadequate
        strategies in dealing with our homeless population.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an attorney I have helped start hundreds of small businesses. I have played a critical role in developing
        non-profit organizations who deliver critical services to low-income residents. I’ve worked to bring desperately
        needed housing to Kern County, including senior housing in Delano and Bakersfield. I’ve helped establish the
        only financial institution to serve the community of Lamont and negotiated to bring millions of dollars to Kern
        County to construct primary health care clinics in Bakersfield, Shafter, and Wasco.
      </p>
      <p>
        My commitment to Kern County is to be the community’s champion for positive and sensible change. I would be
        honored to serve the residents of Kern County and have your vote.

              affordable housing across the Southwestern U.S., and will work diligently with state, county and city
              service providers to develop similar solutions for Kern County.
